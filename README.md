JW Envato
==================

For information related to this plugin check [Plugish.com](http://plugish.com/plugins/jw_envato "View plugin on Plugish.com")

Currently this plugin only provides a 'Popular' category of the Envato API using cURL since that is the most widely accepted method among shared web hosts.  For performance, it caches the API call for 24 hours via WordPress transients as to not provide too much overhead, and be nice to the guys who allow you to use their API.

I plan on adding more functions from the API in the future, but for now, this works perfect for what I need.  If you're curious how it looks just click the above link to view the plugin page.  I'm using the widget on the sidebar.  All issues should be posted here, private messages, emails, etc will be ignored, that's what Github is for.
